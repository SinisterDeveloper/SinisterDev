# Greetings

I'm SinisterDeveloper, a programmer and a student. I'm still in High School and I will be graduating in a few months. I love making open source projects. I believe Open Source is a wonderful tool and a weapon for developers to learn from each other

# Starting Out

I started my journey by developing games on Roblox. I was interested in Roblox as it had great potential and had a lot to offer. It was all going great and fun. However due to some circumstances, I had to stop developing on Roblox. I then became interested in Javascript and NodeJS. This was a big turning point in my journey as Javascript/NodeJS became the first language which I learned proficiently. 

After many months of Javascript, I started learning C++ and Python, which I am currently mastering 

I want to continue learning and contributing; and Github is the perfect place for me. Have a great day ahead!
