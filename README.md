# About Me

I'm a passionate programmer and a freshman at University. With a good interest in open source development, I believe in the power of collaboration and knowledge sharing that open source offers. My goal is to contribute to the developer community while continuously expanding my skills and knowledge.

# Experience

My programming journey began with game development on Roblox, where I explored its vast potential. Although I eventually transitioned from Roblox, this experience ignited my passion for coding. I then focused on mastering JavaScript and Node.js, which became my first strong proficiencies.

Building on this foundation, I am expanding my skills to include C++ and Python, which I am currently learning. My journey is driven by curiosity and a desire to learn, create, and contribute meaningfully to the tech community.

# Goals

Iâ€™m eager to take on new challenges and projects, leveraging GitHub as the platform to collaborate and grow. I look forward to connecting with like-minded developers and making impactful contributions to the open source world.


Have a great day ahead!
