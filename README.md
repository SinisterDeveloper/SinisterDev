# Greetings

I'm SinisterDev, a NodeJS programmer and a student. I'm still in High School and I will be graduating in a few months. I love making Discord Bots and open source projects. I believe Open Source is a wonderful tool and a weapon for developers to learn from each other

# Starting Out

I started my journey by developing games on Roblox. I was interested in Roblox as it had great potential and had a lot to offer. It was all going great and fun. However due to some uncontrollable circumstances, I had to stop developing on Roblox. Which was when I was introduced to Javascript and NodeJS. This was a big turning point in my journey as Javascript became my first programming language which I actually learned *well*. I made and still make useful Discord bots and I plan to make them open source. I've already started doing this, you can check out my [Discord Moderation Bot](https://github.com/SinisterDeveloper/discord-moderation-bot) which I regularly update and I am open for others to contribute to my projects.

I want to continue learning and contributing and Github is the perfect place for me. Have a good day!
